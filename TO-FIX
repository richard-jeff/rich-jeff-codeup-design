different results for R and J:

    branched a copy that works for Richard - 'working-for-richard'

    Changes to 'The Last' title and colum:

        Need to see if this fixes Richard's page display.

/*TODO: I added this to remove the padding to give the sidebar some more space. But definitely add it back if you need it, i was just testing somethings out.*/
.last-thing-no-display{
    padding: 0;
}

    No changes with or without this for me.
